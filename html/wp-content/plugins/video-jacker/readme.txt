== Description ==

Video Jacker manages and controls the videos on your WordPress pages and posts for YouTube, ScreenCast and ViewBix, And if you are a ScreenCast user you will be glad to know that we have fixed the problem associated with ScreenCast embed codes where the Word Press html editor removes or duplicates ScreenCast embed codes.

Simply add the relevant video embed code and Video Jacker gives you a nice convenient short code to use within your pages and posts to avoid code conflicts with the WP HTML editors.

Once installed you will also find access to the up and coming ViewBix video platform which allows you to convert YouTube, Vimeo & MP4 Videos in to amazing video players by adding a portfolio of applications, skins and call to actions … right within and on the videos.

With Video Jacker & ViewBix you can take any MP4, YouTube or Vimeo video and then add:

* Over 26 different applications
* Images, colours and skins
* Call to action buttons
* Clickable logos
* Post roll call to actions
* Bottom logo with call to action
* Email and autoresponder sign up forms
* Social sharing buttons
* Background images

NOTE: The use of ViewBix is free for the first 2 video players and will require a low cost upgrade to add more video players and functionality. Full details and account access are provided within the Video Jacker plugin.
